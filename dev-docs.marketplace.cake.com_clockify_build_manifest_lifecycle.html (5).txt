same permissions and access as the user who is currently viewing the Ul. This token, which in case it's provided

> SIDEBAR

A sidebar entry is an entry that is added to the add-ons section of the Clockify sidebar, located on the left side
of the page. New entries always default to the add-ons section, although they can be manually moved according
to the user's preferences. Add-on can add new element in a sidebar automatically, or if user enables it through

Settings by clicking Show more and Add-ons.
Now, you can specify sidebar's properties:

* Added if at least one enabled add-on has "Sidebar" component specified in manifest
+ Not removed even if empty
» Users can put other elements in it (from other sections)

+ New add-on sidebar elements are always added to the Add-on section

Element can be moved from the Add-on to other sections and is removed from the Add-on section if it is

uninstalled or disabled in the optional add-on’s settings.

Widget

A widget is a small icon which is displayed at the bottom-right section of the page. It serves an entrypoint to Ul

components that are defined with the WIDGET type.
